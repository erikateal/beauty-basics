## How It's Made:

I built this project about a week after being introduced to APIs. I wanted to make something that I would be able to build off of for a larger project that I am working on regarding skincare. This design is fully responsive and allowed me to practice skills such as accessibility, refactoring code, fetching data from APIs, etc.

## What I Learned:

While buidling this project, I learned how to fetch data from an API in JSON format, cache an API for optimized usage, and loop through all of the objects in an array and insert that information into a carousel.
